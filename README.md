AoE2DE Scenario Maker<br>

A 'work in progress' application that will be a graphical user interface that let's you create Age of Empires 2 DE Scenarios.<br>

Note: I do not know if I will actually include the code to save/load/etc. I just mainly want to design it and get it setup for someone to finish. (Hopefully. It depends if I have time or not to work on it.)<br>

Note: At the bare minimum, I want to have a working GUI that maybe someone can take over if needed. (Obviously I intend it to be a "Trigger Studios" type Application. Focusing on Triggers. It would be nice if the 'scenario parser' team could be involved but, that is up to them. Maybe some day. Assuming it can even be included.) I will try to include as much code as I can to help someone finish it if need be. I will be slowly working on it every day. It's made in Visual Basic. So, if you know VB, feel free to look at the source code. If you want to try it out, you can but, remember, it's not even remotely finished. (There is 'some' code in it already though.) You will need "microsoft visual studio community 2022" to open/run it.<br>

1: Download it on the Github.<br>
2: Open it with the "AoE2DE_Scenario_Maker.sln" file.<br>
3: Once opened, you can click the 'green play icon' (AoE2DE_Scenario_Maker) at the top to start it. You can stop it by closing the created new window or clicking the 'red stop icon' in MVSC. (Although, there is not much to be seen yet so, I would not bother unless you already have it or just really want to see it.)<br>

I may release a build of it later. For now, I will just leave the source code up.<br>
